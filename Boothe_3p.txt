l
The file could not be found. Exiting program.
Also, adding the .txt does invalidate as it wants the title and some map could be called "Maze1.txt.txt" or something similar. The goal of saying "enter the file name of the txt file" is to allow clarity of the desired input (the name excluding extensions).
Since Maze1.txt exists, consider:
Please enter the file name of the txt file you wish to use as your maze.
Maze1.txt
The file could not be found. Exiting program.

Due to design of program, it protects against a node reference a nonexistent node. With Z1 as a choice for A1, the program rejects this and informs user the maze file is invalid.
